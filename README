=============

GrapheRRD is a PHP web frontend to MRTG  and  RRD  data  files.   It  draws
custom graphics from MRTG data and  allows  easy  navigation  amongst  data
sources.   Graphs  colors,  sizes  and   time   scale   are   customizable.

Source code is under the GPL (see enclosed LICENSE file).

== Requirements ==
MRTG, RRD, PHP.

== Installation ==
Installation should  be  quite  straighforward.   The  grapherrd  directory
contains all the needed PHP scripts.  You should copy it  to  any  of  your
HTTP PHP enabled server.

snmpd-helper directory contains bash  scripts  to  be  run  from  snmpd  to
collect services statistics and make them available to MRTG.   Scripts  are
provided for the following services:
- DB (mysql)
- DNS (bind and NSD)
- FTP (apache and proftpd)
- HTTP (apache)
- NNTP (INN)
- SMTP (postfix)

== Configuration ==
Configuration is  done  in  3  different  places:  MRTG,  graperrd.cfg  and
graph.cfg

=== MRTG ===
Regular MRTG configuration files should be set so to use the RRD backend.

=== grapherrd.cfg ===
The grapherrd.cfg file contains all the settings you can  change  to  adapt
the output and rendering of the GrapheRRD web pages.  You should also  tell
GrapheRRD where to look for MRTG configuration files, RRD  data  files  and
where to output graphic files produced.  See comments enclosed in the  file
for more information.

=== graph.cfg ===
This file contains  all  the  graphs  definitions:  data  sources,  colors,
legends.  There is already quite a lot of different  graph  types  provided
and adding new ones should be quite easy.  See  comments  enclosed  in  the
file
